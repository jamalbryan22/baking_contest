About this project:
Solve a simple programming problem based on various approaches to computer security and information management.
Build a small scale real-world application that incorporates the principles of secure computing including cryptography, network security, and data protection.
Build small scale real-world applications using third-party Python libraries discussed in the course.
Choose the best library for an application by examining the benefits of various libraries currently used by the industry.
Apply Python towards several contemporary programming requirements and techniques involving secure, distributed, and parallel computing.
Using Python and the hmac, hashlib, and pycryptodome libraries
Assumptions:
The application creates the database upon execution.
In order to access all functionality you must sign in as a user with the highest security level (3)
If you change the application secret key you must ensure they are consistent across the different servers, and it must be 16 bytes
The create_baking_contest_db.py script has to be run first.
